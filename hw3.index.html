<pre><code>. *1. data simulation
. set obs 30 //initialize your dataset with 30 observations usin the command

. *2. variable generation
. gen age=(rnormal()*15)+57 //normal distribution 

. gen age_t=(rt(_N)*15)+57 //instead of normal distribution, t-distribution, _N means degrees of freedom

. *3. Graphical representation
. hist age, ///

**Results:** 
From the normal distribution, 
results. There were  30 observations and 2 variables in the analyzed dataset. Average life expectancy of all countries, $\beta_0$, was  years. Difference in life expectancy among &lt;u&gt;adjacent&lt;/u&gt; countries, $\beta_1$, showed no trend or pattern and was  years, essentially $zero$, and $p$ = 

**Conclusions:** 
In walking you through syntax, do-file creation, queued commands, generated results, through to embedding neatly formatted output in
.html, we believe you now have a sense of what that Stata might offer you. These ideas can be generalized to embedding results 
in .xlsx, .log, .dta, .docx, etc.
